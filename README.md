# lsm6dsl-spin 
--------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller, P2X8C4M64P/Propeller 2 driver object for the ST LSM6DSL 6DoF IMU.

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) ~~or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P)~~. Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* SPI connection at 4MHz (P1)
* Set accelerometer full-scale, data rate
* Read accelerometer raw data, or scaled to micro-G's

## Requirements

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library
* 1 extra core/cog for the PASM SPI engine

~~P2/SPIN2:~~
* ~~p2-spin-standard-library~~

## Compiler Compatibility

* P1/SPIN1: OpenSpin (tested with 1.00.81), FlexSpin (tested with 5.1.0-beta)
* ~~P2/SPIN2: FlexSpin (tested with 5.1.0-beta)~~ _(not yet implemented)_
* ~~BST~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~Propeller Tool~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~PNut~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)

## Limitations

* Very early in development - may malfunction, or outright fail to build

## TODO

- [ ] MANY
